    <p>
      It is an easy-to-use backup tool for files and folders. It runs on GNU
      Linux and provides a command line tool "backintime" and a Qt5 GUI
      "backintime-qt". It uses "rsync" in the back to take manual or scheduled
      snapshots and stores them locally or remotely through SSH. Each snapshot
      is its own folder with copies of the original files, but unchanged files
      are hard-linked between snapshots to save space. It was inspired by
      "FlyBack".

      You only need to specify 3 things:
      <ol>
        <li>What folders to back up.</li>
        <li>Where to save snapshots.</li>
        <li>The backup frequency (manual, every hour, every day, every month)</li>
      </ol>
