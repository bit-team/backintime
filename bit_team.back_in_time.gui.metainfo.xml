      It is an easy-to-use backup tool for files and folders. It runs on GNU Linux and provides a command line tool <code>backintime</code> and a Qt5 GUI <code>backintime-qt</code> both written in Python3. It uses [<code>rsync</code>](https://rsync.samba.org/) to take manual or scheduled snapshots and stores them locally or remotely through SSH. Each snapshot is its own folder with copies of the original files, but unchanged files are hard-linked between snapshots to save space. It was inspired by [FlyBack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FlyBack).

      <em> What folders to back up. </em> Where to save snapshots. * The backup frequency (manual, every hour, every day, every month).y day, every month).
