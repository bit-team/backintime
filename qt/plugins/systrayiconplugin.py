# Jan 23, 2023: This file was named "qt4plugin.py" until now
#               and renamed to better indicate the purpose
#               (and qt4 is no longer valid - we are using qt5 now for long).
#               The old class name "QtPlugin" was also renamed to:
#                   SysTrayIconPlugin

# TODO Known open issues:
# - this script should get started and consider some cmd line arguments from BiT
#   (parsed via backintime.createParsers()) so that the same paths are used,
#   mainly "share-path" and "config" (path to the config file).
#   Otherwise e.g. unit tests or special user path settings may lead to
#   wrong status info in the systray icon!
