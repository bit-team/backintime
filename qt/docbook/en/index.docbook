<!-- The revision numbering system for GNOME manuals is as follows: -->
<!-- * the revision number consists of two components -->
<!-- * the first component of the revision number reflects the release version of the GNOME desktop. -->
<!-- * the second component of the revision number is a decimal unit that is incremented with each revision of the manual. -->
<!-- For example, if the GNOME desktop release is V2.x, the first version of the manual that -->
<!-- is written in that desktop timeframe is V2.0, the second version of the manual is V2.1, etc. -->
<!-- When the desktop release version changes to V3.x, the revision number of the manual changes -->
<!-- to V3.0, and so on. -->

    <releaseinfo>This manual describes version &appversion; of Back In Time.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>&app; is a simple backup tool for Linux (this is KDE4 version). The backup is done by taking snapshots of
	a specified set of folders.</para>
	<para>All you have to do is:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>configure where to save snapshots</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>configure what folders to backup</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>schedule automatic backup: disabled, every 5 minutes, every 10 minutes, every hour, every day, every week, every month</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
	<para>&app; acts as a "user mode" backup tool. This means that you can backup/restore only folders
	you have write access to (actually you can backup read-only folders, but you can't restore them).</para>
	<para>If you want to run it as root you need to use "sudo -i backintime" (command line) or "backintime-qt_polkit" (GUI).</para>
	<para>A new snapshot is created only if something changed since the last snapshot (if any).</para>
	<para>A snapshot contains all the files from the selected folders (except for exclude patterns).
	In order to reduce disk space it use hard-links (if possible) between snapshots for unchanged files.
	This way a file of 10MiB, unchanged for 10 snapshots, will use only 10Mb on the disk.</para>
	<para>When you restore a file 'A', if it already exists on the file system it will be renamed to
	'A.backup.currentdate'.</para>
	<para>This documentation is not maintained (at least for the moment), please use the man-page 'man backintime'
        </para>
