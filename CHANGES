Back In Time

Version 1.4.2-dev (development of upcoming release)
* Fix bug: RTE: module 'qttools' has no attribute 'initate_translator' with encFS when prompting the user for a password (#1553).
* Fix bug: Schedule dropdown menu used "minutes" instead of "hours".
* Build: Use PyLint in unit testing to catch E1101 (no-member) errors.
* Build: Activate PyLint warning W1401 (anomalous-backslash-in-string).
* Build: Add codespell config.
* Translation: Minor modifications in source strings and updating language files.

Version 1.4.1 (2023-10-01)
* Dependency: Add "qt translations" to GUI runtime dependencies (#1538).
* Build: Unit tests do generically ignore all instead of well-known warnings now (#1539).
* Build: Warnings about missing Qt translation now are ignored while testing (#1537).
* Fix bug: GUI didn't start when "show hidden files" button was on (#1535).

Version 1.4.0 (2023-09-14)
* Project: Renamed branch "master" to "main" and started "gitflow" branching model.
* Refactor: Renamed qt4plugin.py to systrayiconplugin.py (we are using Qt5 for years now ;-)
* Refactor: Removed unfinished feature "Full system backup" (#1526)
* Fix bug: AttributeError: can't set attribute 'showHiddenFiles' in app.py (#1532)
* Fix bug: Check SSH login works on machines with limited commands (#1442)
* Fix bug: Missing icon in SSH private key button (#1364)
* Fix bug: Master issue for missing or empty system-tray icon (#1306)
* Fix bug: System-tray icon missing or empty (GUI and cron) (#1236)
* Fix bug: Improve KDE plasma icon compatibility (#1159)

* Fix bug: Unit test fails on some machines due to warning "Ignoring XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland on Gnome..." (#1429)

* Fix bug: Taking a snapshot reports `rsync` errors now even if no snapshot was taken (#1491)
* Fix bug: takeSnapshot() recognizes errors now by also evaluating the rsync exit code (#489)
           Fixes related problem: Killing `rsync` was not handled gracefully (by ignoring the rsync exit code)
* Fix bug: The error user-callback is now always called if an error happened while taking a snapshot (#1491)
* Fix bug: D-Bus serviceHelper error "LimitExceeded: Maximum length of command line reached (100)":
           Max command length is now 120 instead of 100 (#1027)
* Feature: Introduce new error codes for the "error" user callback (as part of #1491):
           5: Error while taking a snapshot.
           6: New snapshot taken but with errors.
* Feature: The `rsync` exit code is now contained in the snapshot log (part of #489). Example:
           [E] Error: 'rsync' ended with exit code -9 (negative values are signal numbers, see 'kill -l')
* Fix bug: Treat rsync exit code 24 as INFO instead of ERROR (#1506)

* Translation: Strings to translate now easier to understand for translators (#1448, #1457, #1462, #1465).

* Translation: Plural forms support (#1488).
* Removed: Translation in Canadian English, British English and Javanese (#1455).
* Added: Translation in Persian and Vietnamese (#1460).
* Added: Message to users (after 10 starts of BIT Gui) to motivate them contributing translations (#1473).

* Fix bug: AttributeError in "Diff Options" dialog (#898)
* Fix bug: Settings GUI: "Save password to Keyring" was disabled due to "no appropriate keyring found" (#1321)

           "dbus.exceptions.DBusException: org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NameHasNoOwner:
            Could not get owner of name 'net.launchpad.backintime.serviceHelper': no such name"
            (fixes client-side part of #921 - system D-Bus part of the Udev serviceHelper is still under investigation).
* Fix bug: Avoid logging errors while waiting for a target drive to be mounted (#1142, #1143, #1328)
