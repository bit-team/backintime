Back In Time

Version 1.4.4-dev (development of upcoming release)
* Fix bug: Open symlinked folders in file view (#1476)
* Fix bug: Respect dark mode using color roles (#1601)
* Fix: "Highly recommended" exclusion pattern in "Manage Profile" dialog's "Exclude" tab show missings only (#1620)
* Build: Activate PyLint error E0401 (import-error)
* Dependency: Migration to PyQt6
* Build: PyLint unit test is skipped if PyLint isn't installed, but will always run on TravisCI (#1634)
* Feature: Support rsync '--one-file-system' in Expert Options (#1598)
* Feature: "*-dev" version strings contain last commit hash (#1637)
* Build: Git commit hash is presevered while "make install" (#1637)
* Build: Fix bash-completion symlink creation while installing & adding --diagnostics (#1615)
* Build: Activate PyLint error E602 (undefined-variable)
* Build: TravisCI use PyQt (except arch "ppc64le")
* Fix bug: `make install` ignored $(DEST) in file migration part (#1630)

Version 1.4.3 (2024-01-30)
* Feature: Exclude 'SingletonLock' and 'SingletonCookie' (Discord) and 'lock' (Mozilla Firefox) files by default (part of #1555)
* Work around: Relax `rsync` exit code 23: Ignore instead of error now (part of #1587)
* Feature (experimental): Add new snapshot log filter `rsync transfer failures (experimental)` to find them easier (they are normally not shown as "error").
                          This feature is experimental because it is based on hard-coded error message strings in the rsync source code
                          and may possibly not find all rsync messages or show false positives.
* Fix bug: 'qt5_probing.py' hangs when BiT is run as root and no user is logged into a desktop environment (#1592 and #1580)
* Fix bug: Launching BiT GUI (root) hangs on Wayland without showing the GUI (#836)
* Improve: Launcher for BiT GUI (root) does not enforce Wayland anymore but uses same settings as for BiT GUI (userland) (#1350)
* Fix bug: Disabling suspend during taking a backup ("inhibit suspend") hangs when BiT is run as root and no user is logged into a desktop environment (#1592)
* Change of semantics: BiT running as root never disables suspend during taking a backup ("inhibit suspend") even though this may have worked before in BiT <= v1.4.1 sometimes (required to fix #1592)
* Fix bug: RTE: module 'qttools' has no attribute 'initate_translator' with encFS when prompting the user for a password (#1553).
* Fix bug: Schedule dropdown menu used "minutes" instead of "hours".
* Fix bug: Unhandled exception "TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable" in tools.py function __log_keyring_warning (#820).
           Logging thread removed and logger module correctly initialized as fix. Is "Heisenbug" so 100 % retesting was not possible.
* Build: Use PyLint in unit testing to catch E1101 (no-member) errors.
* Build: Activate PyLint warning W1401 (anomalous-backslash-in-string).
* Build: Add codespell config.
* Build: Allow manual specification of python executable (--python=PYTHON_PATH) in common/configure and qt/configure
* Build: All starter scripts do use an absolute path to the python executable by default now via common/configure and qt/configure (#1574)
* Build: Install dbus configuration file to /usr/share not /etc (#1596)
* Build: `configure` does delete old installed files (`qt4plugin.py` and `net.launchpad.backintime.serviceHelper.conf`) that were renamed or moved in a previous release (#1596)
* Translation: Minor modifications in source strings and updating language files.
* Refactor: Solved circular dependency between tools.py and logger.py to fix #820
* Improved: qtsystrayicon.py, qt5_probing.py, usercallbackplugin.py and all parts of app.py
            do now also use "backintime" as logging namespace in the syslog to ensure complete log output with `journalctl | grep -i backintime`

Version 1.4.1 (2023-10-01)
* Dependency: Add "qt translations" to GUI runtime dependencies (#1538).
* Build: Unit tests do generically ignore all instead of well-known warnings now (#1539).
* Build: Warnings about missing Qt translation now are ignored while testing (#1537).
* Fix bug: GUI didn't start when "show hidden files" button was on (#1535).

Version 1.4.0 (2023-09-14)
* Project: Renamed branch "master" to "main" and started "gitflow" branching model.
* Refactor: Renamed qt4plugin.py to systrayiconplugin.py (we are using Qt5 for years now ;-)
* Refactor: Removed unfinished feature "Full system backup" (#1526)

* Fix bug: takeSnapshot() recognizes errors now by also evaluating the rsync exit code (#489)
           Fixes related problem: Killing `rsync` was not handled gracefully (by ignoring the rsync exit code)
* Fix bug: The error user-callback is now always called if an error happened while taking a snapshot (#1491)
* Fix bug: D-Bus serviceHelper error "LimitExceeded: Maximum length of command line reached (100)":
           Max command length is now 120 instead of 100 (#1027)
* Feature: Introduce new error codes for the "error" user callback (as part of #1491):
           5: Error while taking a snapshot.
           6: New snapshot taken but with errors.
* Feature: The `rsync` exit code is now contained in the snapshot log (part of #489). Example:
           [E] Error: 'rsync' ended with exit code -9 (negative values are signal numbers, see 'kill -l')
* Fix bug: Treat rsync exit code 24 as INFO instead of ERROR (#1506)
* Breaking change: Minimal Python version 3.8 required (#1358).
* Removed: Handling and checking of user group "fuse" (#1472).
* Feature: Exclude /swapfile by default (#1053)
* Feature: Rearranged menu bar and its entries in the main window (#1487, #1478).
* Feature: Configure user interface language via config file and GUI.
* Documentation: Removed outdated docbook (#1345).
* Build: Introduced .readthedocs.yaml as asked by ReadTheDocs.org (#1443).
* Dependency: The oxygen icons should be installed with the BiT Qt GUI since they are used as fallback in case of missing icons
* Fix bug: Add support for ChainerBackend class as keyring which iterates over all supported keyring backends (#1410)
* Translation: Strings to translate now easier to understand for translators (#1448, #1457, #1462, #1465).
* Translation: Improved completeness of translations and additional modifications of source strings (#1454, #1512)
* Translation: Plural forms support (#1488).
* Removed: Translation in Canadian English, British English and Javanese (#1455).
* Added: Translation in Persian and Vietnamese (#1460).
* Added: Message to users (after 10 starts of BIT Gui) to motivate them contributing translations (#1473).

Version 1.3.3 (2023-01-04)

* Desktop integration: Update .desktop file to mark Back In Time as a single main window program (#1258)
* Feature: Write all log output to stderr; do not pollute stdout with INFO and WARNING messages anymore (#1337)
* Fix bug: RTE "reentrant call inside io.BufferedWriter" in logFile.flush() during backup (#1003)
* Fix bug: Incompatibility with rsync 3.2.4 or later because of rsync's "new argument protection" (#1247). Deactivate "--old-args" rsync argument earlier recommended to users as a workaround.

* Fix bug: AttributeError in "Diff Options" dialog (#898)
* Fix bug: Settings GUI: "Save password to Keyring" was disabled due to "no appropriate keyring found" (#1321)

           "dbus.exceptions.DBusException: org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NameHasNoOwner:
            Could not get owner of name 'net.launchpad.backintime.serviceHelper': no such name"
            (fixes client-side part of #921 - system D-Bus part of the Udev serviceHelper is still under investigation).
* Fix bug: Avoid logging errors while waiting for a target drive to be mounted (#1142, #1143, #1328)
* Fix bug: [Arch Linux] AUR pkg "backintime-git": Build tests fails and installation is aborted (#1233, fixed with #921)
