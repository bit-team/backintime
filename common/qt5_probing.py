# This mini python script is used to determine if a Qt5 GUI application
# can be created without an error.
#
# It is used e.g. for diagnostics output of backintime
# or to check if a system tray icon could be shown...
#
# It is called by "tools.is_Qt5_working()" normally
# but you can also execute it manually via
#     python3 qt5_probing.py

# It works by trying to create a QApplication instance
# Any error indicates that Qt5 is not available or not correctly configured.

# WORK AROUND:
#
# The C++ code of Qt5 ends abruptly with a SIGABRT signal (qFatal macro)
# if a QApplication cannot be instantiated.
# This causes a coredump creation by the python default signal handler
# and the signal handler cannot be disabled since it reacts to a
# non-python low-level signal sent via C/C++.
#
# Even though the coredump message cannot be prevented there is
# workaround to prevent the coredump **file** creation which
# would take too much time just to probe Qt5's availability:
#
#    Use resource.setrlimit() to set resource.RLIMIT_CORE’s soft limit to 0
#
# Note: This does NOT prevent the console output "Aborted (core dumped)"
#       even though no coredump file will be created!
#       You can check that no coredump file was created with the command
#           sudo coredumpctl list -r
#
# More details:
#
# To suppress the creation of coredump file on Linux
# use resource.setrlimit() to set resource.RLIMIT_CORE’s soft limit to 0
# to prevent coredump file creation.

# See "man 2 getrlimit" for more details:
# > RLIMIT_CORE
# >              This  is  the maximum size of a core file (see core(5)) in bytes
# >              that the process may dump.  When 0 no core dump files  are  created
# >              When nonzero, larger dumps are truncated to this size.
# > ...
# > The  soft  limit  is  the value that the kernel enforces for the corresponding resource.
# > The hard limit acts  as  a  ceiling  for  the  soft limit:
# > an  unprivileged process may set only its soft limit to a value
# > in the range from 0 up to the hard limit, and (irreversibly) lower  its
# > hard   limit.    A  privileged  process  (under  Linux:  one  with  the
# > CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capability in the initial user namespace) may make
# > arbitrary changes to either limit value.
