backintime (1.4.3) unstable; urgency=low
  * Feature: Exclude 'SingletonLock' and 'SingletonCookie' (Discord) and 'lock' (Mozilla Firefox) files by default (part of #1555)
  * Work around: Relax `rsync` exit code 23: Ignore instead of error now (part of #1587)
  * Feature (experimental): Add new snapshot log filter `rsync transfer failures (experimental)` to find them easier (they are normally not shown as "error").
                            This feature is experimental because it is based on hard-coded error message strings in the rsync source code
                            and may possibly not find all rsync messages or show false positives.
  * Fix bug: 'qt5_probing.py' hangs when BiT is run as root and no user is logged into a desktop environment (#1592 and #1580)
  * Fix bug: Launching BiT GUI (root) hangs on Wayland without showing the GUI (#836)
  * Improve: Launcher for BiT GUI (root) does not enforce Wayland anymore but uses same settings as for BiT GUI (userland) (#1350)
  * Fix bug: Disabling suspend during taking a backup ("inhibit suspend") hangs when BiT is run as root and no user is logged into a desktop environment (#1592)
  * Change of semantics: BiT running as root never disables suspend during taking a backup ("inhibit suspend") even though this may have worked before in BiT <= v1.4.1 sometimes (required to fix #1592)
  * Fix bug: RTE: module 'qttools' has no attribute 'initate_translator' with encFS when prompting the user for a password (#1553).
  * Fix bug: Schedule dropdown menu used "minutes" instead of "hours".
  * Fix bug: Unhandled exception "TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable" in tools.py function __log_keyring_warning (#820).
             Logging thread removed and logger module correctly initialized as fix. Is "Heisenbug" so 100 % retesting was not possible.
  * Build: Use PyLint in unit testing to catch E1101 (no-member) errors.
  * Build: Activate PyLint warning W1401 (anomalous-backslash-in-string).
  * Build: Add codespell config.
  * Build: Allow manual specification of python executable (--python=PYTHON_PATH) in common/configure and qt/configure
  * Build: All starter scripts do use an absolute path to the python executable by default now via common/configure and qt/configure (#1574)
  * Build: Install dbus configuration file to /usr/share not /etc (#1596)
  * Build: `configure` does delete old installed files (`qt4plugin.py` and `net.launchpad.backintime.serviceHelper.conf`) that were renamed or moved in a previous release (#1596)
  * Translation: Minor modifications in source strings and updating language files.
  * Refactor: Solved circular dependency between tools.py and logger.py to fix #820
  * Improved: qtsystrayicon.py, qt5_probing.py, usercallbackplugin.py and all parts of app.py
              do now also use "backintime" as logging namespace in the syslog to ensure complete log output with `journalctl | grep -i backintime`
