# Good to know about allowed/ignored words:
# Codespell acts a bit unusual when it comes to case-sensitivity.
# By default the word "Manuel" is an error and codespell recommends to
# modify it into "Manual". To allow this German name "Manuel" we have to
# add "manual" (lower case!) to the "ignore-words-list". The upper-case
# version do not work.

# Simulate "# noqa" and ignore all lines with "# codespell-ignore" at the end.
