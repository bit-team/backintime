# TravisCI (https://travis-ci.org) configuration file

# Note about PyQt related unit tests:
# They are not executed on architecture "ppc64le". For this architecture
# PyQt is not available from PyPi and not installable via pip.
# The alternative to use "system-site-packages" option and installing PyQt
# from Ubuntu repository via "apt" is not working as expected. TravisCI
# allow "system-site-packages" only for those Python interpreteres that are
# offered by Ubuntu itself; Python 3.8 in case of Ubuntu Focal. Other Python
# versions are installed from other sources into a virtual environment and
# not allowed to use packages installed via "apt".
