# How to contribute to _Back In Time_

ðŸ˜Š **Thanks for taking the time to contribute!**

The maintenance team will welcome all types of contributions. No contribution
will be rejected just because it doesn't fit to our quality standards,
guidelines or rules. Every contribution is reviewed and if needed will be
improved together with the maintainers.

Please always make a new branch when preparing a Pull Request ("PR") or a patch.
Baseline that feature or bug fix branch on `dev` (the latest development
state). When open a pull request please make sure that it targets
`bit-team:dev`.

Please take the following best practices into account if possible (to reduce
	the work load of the maintainers and to increase the chance that your pull
	request is accepted):
 - Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) as a minimal Style Guide
   for Python Code
 - Follow [Google Style Guide](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.org/en/latest/example_google.html) for
   docstrings (see our own [HOWTO about doc generation](common/doc-dev/1_doc_maintenance_howto.md)).
 - Be careful when using automatic formatters like `black` and please mention
   the use of it when opening a pull request.
 - Run unit tests before you open a Pull Request. You can run them via
   `make`-system with `cd common && ./configure && make && make test` or you
   can use `pytest`.
 - Try to create new unit tests if appropriated. Use Pythons regular `unittest`
   instead of `pytest`. If you know the difference please try follow the
   _Classical (aka Detroit) school_ instead of _London (aka mockist) school_.

## Build & Install

This section describes how to build and install _Back In Time_ in preparation
of your own contributions. It is assumed that you `git clone` this repository
first.

### Dependencies

The following dependencies are based on Ubuntu. Please [open an
Issue](https://github.com/bit-team/backintime/issues/new/choose) if something
is missing. If you use another GNU/Linux distribution, please install the
corresponding packages. Be aware that some of the named packages can be
replaced with PyPi packages.

* Runtime dependencies for the CLI

  - `python3` (>= 3.8)
  - `rsync`
  - `cron-daemon`
  - `openssh-client`
  - `python3-keyring`
  - `python3-dbus`
  - `python3-packaging`
  -  Recommended
     - `sshfs`
     - `encfs`

* Runtime dependencies for the GUI

  - `x11-utils`
  - `python3-pyqt5`
  - `python3-dbus.mainloop.pyqt5`
  - `libnotify-bin`
  - `policykit-1`
  - `qttranslations5-l10n`
  - `qtwayland5` (if Wayland is used as display server instead of X11)
  - Recommended
      - For SSH key storage **one** of these packages
        - `python3-secretstorage`
        - `python3-keyring-kwallet`
        - `python3-gnomekeyring`
      - For diff-like comparing files between backup snapshots **one** of these
        packages
        - `kompare`
        - or `meld`
      - Optional: Default icons
        - The `oxygen` icons should be offered as optional dependency
          since they are used as fallback in case of missing icons
          (mainly app and system-tray icons)

* Build and testing dependencies
  - All runtime dependencies for CLI and GUI including the recommended
  - `build-essential`
  - `gzip`
  - `gettext`
  - `python3-pyfakefs`
  - `pylint`

### Build and install via `make` system (recommended)

Remember that _Back In Time_ does consist of two packages, which must be built
and installed separately accordingly.

* Command line tool
   1. `cd common`
   2. `./configure && make`
   3. Run unit tests via `make test`
   4. `sudo make install`

* Qt GUI
   1. `cd qt`
   2. `./configure && make`
   3. Run unit tests via `make test`
   4. `sudo make install`

You can use optional arguments to `./configure` for creating a Makefile.
See `common/configure --help` and `qt/configure --help` for details.

### Build own `deb` file

1. Run `./makedeb.sh` in the repositories root directory.
2. Two `deb` files are built and places in the repositories parent directory.
3. Install the packages
  - `sudo dpkg -i ../backintime-common-<version>.deb`
  - `sudo dpkg -i ../backintime-qt-<version>.deb`
